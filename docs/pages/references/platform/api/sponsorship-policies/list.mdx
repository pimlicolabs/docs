## HTTP Request

`GET /v2/account/sponsorship_policies`

A cursor to use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo to fetch the next page of the list.

A cursor to use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar to fetch the previous page of the list.
