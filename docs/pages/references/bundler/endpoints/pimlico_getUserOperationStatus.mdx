# pimlico_getUserOperationStatus

This method takes in a user operation hash and returns the status of the operation and, optionally, the transaction hash the bundler is using to bundle the user operation on-chain. The status can be one of the following:


| result   | response includes transaction hash | description |
| :------- | :------------------------ | :---------- |
| `not_found` |  false |  the operation hash is not known to the bundler or has been rejected during validation and has never entered the mempool |
| `not_submitted` |  false |  the operation hash is known to the bundler but is sitting in the mempool and has not been bundled into a transaction yet |
| `submitted`   | true |  the operation hash is known to the bundler, has been bundled into a transaction which is currently pending in the mempool |
| `rejected`    | false |  the operation hash has entered the mempool but as it was being bundled into a bundle transaction the re-simulation failed and it was never submitted |
| `included`    | true |  the operation hash is known to the bundler and has been included on-chain |
| `failed`    | true |  the operation hash is known to the bundler and the transaction bundling it has been included on-chain but the bundle transaction reverted |
| `queued`    | false |  the operation hash is known to the bundler but is waiting in a queue before being sent to the mempool due to its nonce being too high |

:::info
Note: the transaction hash returned when the result is `submitted` can change if the bundler resubmits the user operation inside a different transaction. For this reason, when showing the pending transaction hash to the user, it is recommended to keep calling this method in case the transaction hash changes.

:::warning
Status is only stored for **one hour**. After this period, queries will return `not_found`.
