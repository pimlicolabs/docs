# AA14 initCode must return sender

The address of the smart account deployed with the `initCode` provided does not match match the `sender` address provided in the user operation.

## Possible solutions

- Verify that the `sender` address was generated deterministically from the `initCode`. (consider leveraging functions like [getSenderAddress](/references/permissionless/reference/public-actions/getSenderAddress))
- Verify that the factory address in the `initCode` is correct (the factory address is the first 20 bytes of the `initCode`).
- Verify that the `initCode` is correct.
- If all else fails, investigate why the `initCode` deploys to a different address than expected using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
