# How to use the Verifying Paymaster

Paymasters are entities that user operations can delegate the responsibilities for gas fee payments for. You can interact with paymasters using JSON-RPC requests.

To get access to the paymaster, you need to sign up to the [Pimlico dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io), create a [Pimlico API key](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys). Next, load up some balance to your Pimlico account in the [payment methods page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/payment) or add your card. Then, using the API key, you can make the following JSON-RPC requests to the paymaster:
