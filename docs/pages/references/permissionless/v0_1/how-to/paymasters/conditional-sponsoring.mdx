# How to conditionally sponsor a user operation

The permissionless.js library allows you to conditionally sponsor a user operation. This can be useful in situations like:

- Sponsor only first 10 transactions
- Sponsor if they have a specific NFT

The use cases can be many, but the general idea is to use the `middleware.sponsorUserOperation` parameter to conditionally sponsor a user operation.

Let's take an example where you want to sponsor only the first 10 transactions.

:::::steps
### Create the clients

First we must create the public, bundler, and (optionally) paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SimpleAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:client]
```

### Create an account

Now, create an account. This can any of the accounts supported by permissionless.js or custom accounts conforming to the interface. For this example, we'll use a Simple account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:account]
```

### Create the smart account client with the custom paymaster logic

When creating the `smartAccountClient`, we can pass in a `middleware.sponsorUserOperation` function that will be called before a user operation is signed and sent.
This function can conditionally choose to add a paymaster to the user operation if the desired conditions are met.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:smart-account-client]
```
