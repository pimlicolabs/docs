# How to create and use a Thirdweb account with permissionless.js

## Picking an EntryPoint

Thirdweb is compatible with EntryPoint versions v0.6 and v0.7. In this guide, we will use EntryPoint v0.7.

## Steps

:::::steps

### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:imports]
```

### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the account.

:::info
Get your client ID from the [Thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys) for free RPC access.
:::

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:clients]
```

### Create the signer

Thirdweb's accounts can work with any Viem signing account [available in permissionless.js](/permissionless/how-to/signers).

In this guide, we'll use a private key to create the signer:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:signer]
```

### Create the thirdweb account

With your new signer, you can create a thirdweb account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:smartAccount]
```

The account's address is computed deterministically from the signer, but you can optionally pass an `salt` to create any number of different accounts using the same signer. You can also pass an `address` to use an already created thirdweb account.

### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/thirdweb.ts:submitBatch]
```
