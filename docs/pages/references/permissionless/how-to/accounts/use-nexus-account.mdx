# How to create and use a Biconomy Nexus account with permissionless.js

[Biconomy Nexus Smart Account](https://github.com/bcnmy/nexus) is a smart account building on the core concepts of ERC-7579. You can use Nexus with plugins such as session keys, and even write your own plugins.

## Steps

::::steps

### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:imports]
```

### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the Nexus account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:clients]
```

### Create the signer

Nexus accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig. In permissionless.js, the default Nexus account validates ECDSA signatures. [Any signer](/references/permissionless/how-to/signers) can be used as a signer for the Nexus account.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:signer]
```

### Create the Nexus account

With a signer, you can create a Nexus account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:smartAccount]
```

The Nexus account address is computed deterministically from the signer, but you can optionally pass an `index` to create any number of different accounts using the same signer. You can also pass an `address` to use an already created Nexus account.

### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submitBatch]
```
