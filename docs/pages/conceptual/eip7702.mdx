# EIP-7702

EIP-7702 is a proposal set for inclusion in the upcoming 2025 Pectra hardfork. The proposal introduces a new transaction type that allows EOA's to assign a "delegation designator" to their account. The delegation designator points to a smart contract and when a transaction is sent to the EOA, it executes the code at the designated address.

This unlocks huge benefits for EOAs, as they can now access smart account features such as batching transactions, gas sponsorships, passkeys as signers, and more.
