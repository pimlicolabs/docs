# How to use MetaMask Smart Accounts with permissionless.js

:::info
MetaMask maintains their own in-house SDK built on top of Viem that you can use for the account system while still plugging in all the other components from permissionless.js. See [their documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit) for more information.
:::

The [MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit) enables embedding MetaMask Smart Accounts into dapps. [Delegation](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/guides/delegation/execute-on-smart-accounts-behalf) is a core feature of smart accounts, enabling secure, rule-based permission sharing.

There are two types of accounts involved in delegation:

1. **Delegator account**: A smart account that supports programmable account behavior and advanced features such as multi-signature approvals, automated transaction batching, and custom security policies.
2. **Delegate account**: An account (smart account or EOA) that receives the delegation from the delegator account to perform actions on behalf of the delegator account.

You can use both accounts with permissionless.js.

## Installation

Use MetaMask's official SDK to create a smart account.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install permissionless viem @metamask/smart-accounts-kit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add permissionless viem @metamask/smart-accounts-kit
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install permissionless viem @metamask/smart-accounts-kit
```

```bash [bun]
bun install permissionless viem @metamask/smart-accounts-kit
```

## Delegator account

::::steps

### Create the clients

First, create the public client and (optional) pimlico paymaster client that will be used to interact with the MetaMask smart account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:clients]
```

### Create the signer

MetaMask Smart Accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms, such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:signer]
```

### Create the delegator smart account

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a MetaMask smart account, see [the MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/guides/smart-accounts/create-smart-account).
:::

With a signer, you can create a MetaMask smart account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:smartAccount]
```

### Create the smart account client

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing Viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use Viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:submitBatch]
```

## Delegate account

A delegate account is an account that receives the delegation from the delegator account to perform actions on behalf of the delegator account.
The delegate account can be a MetaMask smart account or an EOA.
The following example uses a smart account.

::::steps

### Create the clients

First, create the public client and (optional) pimlico paymaster client that will be used to interact with the MetaMask smart account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:clients]
```

### Create the signer

MetaMask Smart Accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms, such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:delegateSigner]
```

### Create the delegate smart account

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a MetaMask smart account, see [the MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/guides/smart-accounts/create-smart-account).
:::

With a delegate signer, you can create a MetaMask delegate account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:delegateSmartAccount]
```

### Create a delegation

This example uses the ERC-20 transfer scope, which ensures that ERC-20 token transfers made by the delegate account are limited to a specified amount.
You can read more about the Smart Accounts Kit's [delegation scopes](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/guides/delegation/use-delegation-scopes).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:createDelegation]
```

### Sign the delegation

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:signDelegation]
```

### Create the smart account client

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:delegateSmartAccountClient]
```

### Send transactions using signed delegation

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:sendTransactionWithDelegation]
```
