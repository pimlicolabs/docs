# Create API Key

To use Pimlico's services, you'll need an API key. We recommend using our CLI for the quickest setup, but you can also use the dashboard.

## Using the CLI (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is with our CLI tool. Run the following command from your project's root directory:

```bash
pnpm dlx @pimlico/cli@latest
```

This command will:
- Interactively guide you through the setup process
- Create your API key automatically
- Add it to your `.env` file for immediate use

## Using the Dashboard

Alternatively, you can create an API key through our web dashboard:

1. Go to the [Pimlico Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Click **API Keys** in the sidebar
4. Click **Create API key**
5. Copy your API key and add it to your project's `.env` file

:::tip
Save your API key securely as you'll need it for all API requests. You can always retrieve it later from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys).

## Next Steps

Once you have your API key:
- Add it to your `.env` file as `PIMLICO_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Start building with our [tutorials](/guides/tutorials/)
