## FAQ

### How do we calculate the paymaster surcharge?

When you request paymaster data using `pm_getPaymasterData`, you need to include the user operation with the gas fees value. We sign the gas fees you specify because it’s the bundler’s responsibility to reject user operations that underpay them. Once the transaction is included on-chain, we use the `actualGasCost` based on the details in the `UserOperationEvent`.

Here’s how `entryPoint` determines the `actualGasCost` and calculates the gas price:

```javascript
const gasPrice = min(userop.maxFeePerGas, baseFee + userop.maxPriorityFeePerGas);
const actualGasCost = actualGas * gasPrice;
```

At the end of the month, we add a 10% surcharge to the `actualGasCost` and bill you. The total billed amount is:

```javascript
const billedAmount = actualGasCost * 1.1; // 10% surcharge
```

Why don’t we charge 10% based on what the bundler pays? Because we might not be the bundler—you’re free to use any bundler available. Since the paymaster pays the `gasCost` to the bundler, and there’s no guarantee that we will be the bundler, we must charge the full `actualGasCost` plus the surcharge.

### Where do I find a gas tank to top up my paymaster?

You do not need to top up you paymaster with Pimlico. We manage the paymaster for you automatically. We track your usage and generate an invoice for you at the end of the month which you can pay with your preferred payment method.
