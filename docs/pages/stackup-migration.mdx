## Pimlico Overview

With Pimlico, you'll have largely the same functionality as Stackup, with a few small differences and several new features.

### Dashboard

The Pimlico dashboard offers a wide range of features to help streamline your smart account development.

Dashboard features include:
- [Rich analytics and metrics](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/metrics)
- [Logs and requests overview](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/logs)
- [Debugging tools](/infra/platform/debugging/dropped-user-operations#how-to-debug-dropped-user-operations)
- [Gas grants](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies)
- [Sponsorship policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies)

### API Credit system

Pimlico uses a transparent API credit system, ensuring fair billing based on your actual usage. The 'worth' of each API credit is different than it is for Stackup. The API cost of each RPC call is detailed on our [pricing page](/infra/platform/pricing).

### API Endpoint changes

There are several API changes you may need to implement for a successful migration.

#### pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice

The Pimlico bundler requires gasPrices to be fetched from the `pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice` endpoint. This is necessary to ensure the UserOperation is sent with a sufficient gas price regardless of network conditions.

#### Separate RPC for node requests

The Stackup endpoint supports both standard RPC and ERC-4337 calls, but Pimlico only supports ERC-4337. During migration, you'll need a separate RPC provider for standard calls.

### Multichain support

The Pimlico API supports seamless multichain access. This means that the same API key and sponsorship policies (if configured) can be used on all chains. The API uses a standardized endpoint structure for all networks:

```ts
const endpoint = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/${chainId}/rpc?apikey=${apiKey}`
```

where `chainId` specifies the target chainId. The Pimlico bundler is currently live on 90+ chains, the full breakdown can be found on the [supported-chains page](/infra/platform/supported-chains).

### ERC-20 Paymaster endpoint

If you are using Stackup's `pm_getERC20TokenQuotes` endpoint, you can migrate to Pimlico's `pimlico_getTokenQuotes`. The Pimlico endpoint does not take in a user operation, however you can follow this [guide](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/how-to/use-paymaster) to achieve the same functionality.

### Origin and user agent whitelist

If you were previously using Stackup's origin whitelist or user agent whitelist, you can apply the same settings by navigating to apikeys and clicking the edit button.
