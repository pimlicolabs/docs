# How to use a DFNS signer with permissionless.js

[Dfns](https://www.dfns.co/) is an MPC/TSS Wallet-as-a-Service API/SDK provider. Dfns aims to optimize the balance of security and UX by deploying key shares into a decentralized network on the backend while enabling wallet access via biometric open standards on the frontend like Webauthn. Reach out [here](https://www.dfns.co/learn-more) to set up a sandbox environment to get started.

## Setup

To use Dfns with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Dfns.

- Refer to the [Dfns documentation site](https://docs.dfns.co/d/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Dfns.

## Integration
Integrating permissionless.js with Dfns is straightforward after setting up the project. Dfns provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

### Set up Dfns
After following the Dfns documentation, you will have access to a `dfnsWallet` object as shown below:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/dfns.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js
