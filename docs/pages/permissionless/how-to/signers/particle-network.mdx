# How to use a Particle Network signer with permissionless.js

[Particle Network](https://particle.network/) is an intent-centric, modular wallet-as-a-service (WaaS). By utilizing MPC-TSS for key management, Particle can streamline onboarding via familiar Web2 methods such as Google, emails, and phone numbers.

By combining permissionless.js with Particle, you can use Particle to enable a smooth social login experience, while using ZeroDev as the smart wallet to sponsor gas for users, batch transactions, and more.

## Setup

To use Particle Network with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Particle Network.

- Refer to the [Particle Network documentation site](https://docs.particle.network/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Particle Network.
- For a quick start, Particle Network provides a guide, available [here](https://docs.particle.network/getting-started/get-started).

## Integration
Integrating permissionless.js with Particle Network is straightforward after setting up the project. Particle Network provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

### Create the Particle Network object
After following the Particle Network documentation, you will have access to a `ParticleProvider` object as shown below that you can pass as an owner to `createeSmartAccountClient`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/particle-network.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js
