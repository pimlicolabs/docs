# How to use a Particle Network signer with permissionless.js

[Particle Network](https://particle.network) provides Wallet Abstraction services that simplify user onboarding.

The [Particle Auth SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) offers seamless 2-click onboarding using social logins. It allows users to quickly sign up using familiar Web2 options like Google, email, or phone numbers. Particle uses MPC-TSS for secure key management, ensuring both convenience and security.

For a streamlined social login experience, you can combine Particle with permissionless.js while leveraging ZeroDev as the smart wallet. This setup enables features like gas fee sponsorship, transaction batching, and more, enhancing the user experience within your application.

## Setup 

To use Particle Network with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Particle Network.

- Follow the Quickstart on the [Particle docs](https://developers.particle.network/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/auth/web-quickstart) to quickly spin up a Particle Auth project.

## Integration

Integrating permissionless.js with Particle Network is straightforward after setting up the project. Particle Network provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

### Initialize the Particle Network Object

After setting up your Particle Auth project, you’ll have access to a `provider` object via the `useEthereum()` hook, as shown below. You can then pass this `provider` as the owner parameter when initializing `createSmartAccountClient`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/particle-network.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js
