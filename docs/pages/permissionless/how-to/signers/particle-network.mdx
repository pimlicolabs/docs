# How to use a Particle Network signer with permissionless.js

[Particle Network](https://particle.network) provides Wallet Abstraction services that simplify user onboarding.

The [Particle Auth SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) offers seamless 2-click onboarding using social logins, powered by MPC-TSS. It allows users to quickly sign up using familiar Web2 options like Google, email, or phone numbers. 

For a streamlined social login experience, you can combine Particle with permissionless.js while leveraging any smart account; as Particle acts as a signer. This setup enables features like gas fee sponsorship, transaction batching, and more, further enhancing the user experience within your application.

## Setup 

To use Particle Network with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Particle Network.

- Follow the Quickstart on the [Particle docs](https://developers.particle.network/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/auth/web-quickstart) to quickly spin up a Particle Auth project.

## Integration

Integrating permissionless.js with Particle Network is straightforward after setting up the project. Particle Network provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

### Initialize the Particle Network Object

After setting up your Particle Auth project, youâ€™ll have access to a `provider` object via the `useEthereum()` hook, as shown below. You can then pass this `provider` as the owner parameter when initializing `createSmartAccountClient`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/particle-network.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js
