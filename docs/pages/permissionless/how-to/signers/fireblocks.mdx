# How to use a Fireblocks signer with permissionless.js

[Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/) is a user-friendly platform designed for building blockchain-based products and managing digital asset operations. It uses a direct custody approach, combining high performance with zero counterparty risk and multi-layered security. The platform includes secure MPC-based digital asset wallets, a policy engine for governance and transaction rules, and comprehensive treasury management. Fireblocks' security framework features multiple layers, including MPC-CMP technology, secure enclaves, and a robust policy engine, ensuring protection against cyberattacks, internal threats, and human errors. It's widely used for various operations like treasury, trading, and managing NFTs, smart contracts, and user wallets.

## Setup

To use Fireblocks with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Fireblocks.

- Refer to the [Fireblocks documentation site](https://developers.fireblocks.com/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Fireblocks.
- For a quick start, Fireblocks provides a guide, available [here](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/quickstart).

## Integration
Integrating permissionless.js with Fireblocks is straightforward after setting up the project. Fireblocks provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

### Create the Fireblocks object
After following the Fireblocks documentation, you will have access to a `FireblocksWeb3Provider` object as shown below which you can use to create a `SmartAccountSigner` object:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/fireblocks.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js
