# EIP-7702 Demo

This demo shows how to use ERC-4337 with EIP-7702 to enable smart account features for EOAs.

## Prerequisites

- An EOA (Externally Owned Account)
- Basic understanding of ERC-4337 and EIP-7702

## Implementation

Here's a basic example of how to use EIP-7702 with an EOA:

```typescript
import { createEip7702Client } from "permissionless"

// Create an EIP-7702 client
const client = await createEip7702Client({
  account,
  chain,
  transport,
  sponsorUserOperation: true // Optional: Enable gas sponsorship
})

// Send a user operation
const userOpHash = await client.sendUserOperation({
  target: "0x...", // Contract to interact with
  data: "0x...", // Encoded function call
  value: 0n // Optional: Amount of ETH to send
})

// Wait for the user operation to be included
const receipt = await client.waitForUserOperationReceipt({ hash: userOpHash })
```

## Features

With EIP-7702, your EOA can now:

1. **Batch Transactions**: Send multiple transactions in a single user operation
2. **Gas Sponsorship**: Have transaction fees sponsored by a paymaster
3. **Smart Account Features**: Access features like account recovery and multisig
4. **Passkey Support**: Use WebAuthn/passkeys for signing

## Benefits

- No need to deploy a smart contract account
- Maintain EOA security model
- Access all ERC-4337 features
- Reduced gas costs
- Improved UX with batching and sponsorship
