# How to create and use a Safe account with permissionless.js

[Safe](https://safe.global) is the most battle-tested Ethereum smart account provider. With their recent release of their ERC-4337 module, it is now possible to plug in Safe accounts to ERC-4337 bundlers and paymasters. This guide will walk you through how to create and use a Safe account with permissionless.js.

## Steps

::::steps

### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:imports]
```

### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the Safe account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:clients]
```

### Create the signer

The Safe account will need to have a signer to sign user operations. In permissionless.js, the default Safe account validates ECDSA signatures. [Any permissionless.js-compatible signer](/permissionless/how-to/signers) can be used for the Safe account.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:signer]
```

### Create the Safe account

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a Safe account, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`toSafeSmartAccount`](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toSafeSmartAccount).
:::

With a signer, you can create a Safe account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:smartAccount]
```

### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe.ts:submitBatch]
```

### Understanding the errors

If you're getting an error that starts with `GS`, it probably means that something went off with the Safe account. Checkout the Safe error codes [here](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/main/docs/error_codes.md).
