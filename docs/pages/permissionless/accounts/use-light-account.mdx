# How to create and use a LightAccount with permissionless.js

[LightAccount](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account) is the smart account implementation made by Alchemy and inspired by SimpleAccount.
It has a few additional [features](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account?tab=readme-ov-file#features), such as transferrable ownership and upgradability.
This guide will show you how to create and use a LightAccount with permissionless.js.

## Steps

::::steps

### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:imports]
```

### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the LightAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:clients]
```


### Create the LightAccount

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a LightAccount, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`toLightSmartAccount`](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toLightSmartAccount).
:::

You can also pass an `address` to use an already created LightAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:smartAccount]
```


### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:smartAccountClient]
```


### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:submitBatch]
```
