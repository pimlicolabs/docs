# How to create and use a SimpleAccount with permissionless.js

[SimpleAccount](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) is the original reference sample implementation of an ERC-4337 made by the Eth-Infinitism team. Despite being a reference implementation, it is widely used in production. It allows for a single EOA signer to sign user operations for the account. This guide will show you how to create and use a SimpleAccount with permissionless.js.

## Steps

::::steps

### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/accounts/simple.ts:imports]
```

### Create the clients

First we must create the public, bundler, and (optionally) paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SimpleAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/accounts/simple.ts:clients]
```


### Create the SimpleAccount

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a SimpleAccount, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`signerToSimpleSmartAccount`](/permissionless/v0_1/reference/accounts/signerToSimpleSmartAccount).
:::

You can create a SimpleAccount with the canonical module addresses by specifying the factory address the account will be deployed from. You can also pass an `address` to use an already created SimpleAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/accounts/simple.ts:smartAccount]
```

### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/accounts/simple.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/accounts/simple.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/accounts/simple.ts:submitNft]
```
