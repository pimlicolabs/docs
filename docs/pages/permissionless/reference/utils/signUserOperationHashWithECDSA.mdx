# signUserOperationHashWithECDSA

Signs the hash of the User Operation with the standard ECDSA signature scheme (used by all EOAs and most smart wallets).

Can take in either the hash of the User Operation or a combination of the User Operation, chain ID and entry point address (calculating the hash internally).

Requires either a walletClient or a localAccount to be passed in that will be used to sign the hash.

## Import

```ts
import { signUserOperationHashWithECDSA } from "permissionless"
```

## Usage

The function can take in either a combination of `userOperation` and `chainId` or a `userOperationHash`, or alternatively a `hash` can be passed in directly.

```ts
import { signUserOperationHashWithECDSA, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 } from "permissionless"

const signature = await signUserOperationHashWithECDSA({
    account: localAccount, // or client: walletClient
    userOperation: ...,
    chainId: 5,
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07
})
// "0x2d9420e06e41603c60ce395cfab6821f09c3c2461734dd785f24084a8ee138774f5d1910fb6d2d560934b21946a9667ada6077b5ac143c0d6a5d93e903c172101b"

// or

const signature = await signUserOperationHashWithECDSA({
    account: localAccount, // or client: walletClient
    hash: "0xf0d56baa398828898360589d5ef75b24b12be0829ef1e1037013d1b6d9dda1f2"
})
// "0x2d9420e06e41603c60ce395cfab6821f09c3c2461734dd785f24084a8ee138774f5d1910fb6d2d560934b21946a9667ada6077b5ac143c0d6a5d93e903c172101b"
```
