# getAccountNonce

Returns the current nonce of the smart account for a specified key. 

## Usage

::::code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { publicClient } from "./client.ts"
import { getAccountNonce, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 } from "permissionless"

const nonce = await getAccountNonce(publicClient, {
    address: "0x277F6C1D8d4faFA3d8DcC837489cd69d86c682BA",
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
    key: 0n // optional
})
// 23n
```

```ts [client.ts]
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({ 
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/...")
})
```

## Returns

- **Type:** `bigint`

The current nonce of the smart account for the specified key (both the key and the sequence concatenated together into one uint256).

## Parameters

### address

- **Type:** `Address`

The address of the smart account.

### entryPoint

- **Type:** `Address`

The entry point address.

### key (optional)

- **Type:** `bigint`

The key of the nonce. Defaults to 0n.

Instead of sequential nonce, ERC-4337 implements a nonce mechanism that uses a single uint256 nonce value in the UserOperation, but treats it as two values, a 192-bit “key”, and a 64-bit “sequence”. These values are represented on-chain in the EntryPoint contract. For each key the sequence is validated and incremented sequentially and monotonically by the EntryPoint for each UserOperation, however a new key can be introduced with an arbitrary value at any point.
