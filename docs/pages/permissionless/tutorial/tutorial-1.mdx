# Tutorial 1 — Send your first gasless transaction

In this tutorial, you will submit your first fully-gasless transaction from a smart account.

You will set up the necessary permissionless.js clients, create a user operation, ask Pimlico's verifying paymaster to sponsor it, and then submit it on-chain with Pimlico's bundler.

## Steps

::::steps

### Get a Pimlico API key

To get started, please go to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and generate a Pimlico API key.

### Clone the Pimlico tutorial template repository

We have created a [Pimlico tutorial template repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template) that you can use to get started. It comes set up with Typescript, viem, and permissionless.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template.git pimlico-tutorial-1
cd pimlico-tutorial-1
```

Now, let's install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The main file we will be working with is `index.ts`. Let's run it to make sure everything is working:

```bash
npm start
```

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see `Hello world!` printed to the console.

### Create the public and paymaster clients, and generate a private key

The public client will be responsible for querying the blockchain, while the paymaster client will be responsible for interacting with Pimlico's verifying paymaster endpoint and requesting sponsorship.

Make sure to replace `YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY` in the code below with your actual Pimlico API key.

Let's open up `index.ts`, and add the following to the bottom:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:clients]
```

### Create the `SmartAccount` instance

For the purposes of this guide, we will be using [Safe](https://safe.global) accounts. This account is an ERC-4337 wallet controlled by a single EOA signer.

:::

To create the Safe account, we will use the `signerToSafeSmartAccount` utility function from permissionless.js. We need to specify the Safe version we are using as well as the global ERC-4337 EntryPoint address. For the signer, we will be using the previously generated private key.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```ts 
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:smartAccount]
```

Let's run this code with `npm start`. You should see the smart account address printed to the console.

```txt
Smart account address: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x374b42bCFAcf85FDCaAB84774EA15ff36D42cdA7
```

:::info
If you visit the address on Etherscan, you might notice that no contract is actually deployed to this address yet. This is because smart account are counterfactual, meaning that they are only deployed on-chain the first time you send a transaction through the account.

### Create the bundler and smart account clients

Now that we have a `SmartAccount` instance, we need to create a `SmartAccountClient` instance to be able to transact from it. `SmartAccountClient` is an almost drop-in replacement for a viem [`WalletClient`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet), but it also includes some additional functionality for interacting with smart accounts. 

We then specify the optional `sponsorUserOperation` middleware function, calling the `sponsorUserOperation` function from the paymaster client. This will make sure that the user operation is sponsored by Pimlico's verifying paymaster.

Finally, we specify the `gasPrice` middleware function to fetch the gas price from the bundler that we will use to submit the user operation in the next step.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Submit a transaction from the smart account

Finally, let's submit a transaction from the smart account. We will send a transaction to the `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (vitalik.eth) address with `0x1234` as example `callData`.

Underneath the hood, the `SmartAccountClient` will build a user operation, request Pimlico paymaster sponsorship, sign it with the smart account's private key, and then submit it to the bundler. The bundler will then query for receipts until it sees the user operation included on-chain.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:submit]
```

Let's run this code again with `npm start`. You should see the transaction hash bundling the user operation on-chain printed to the console.

```txt
User operation included: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x7a2b61b4b7b6e9e66c459e3c9c24c7a292fc6c740533ce35dbf58710960cc0e5
```

You can now view the transaction on the Sepolia testnet explorer. By sending this user operation, you have:
- Deployed the counterfactual smart account contract
- Had this newly-deployed smart account verify the private key's signature
- Made Pimlico's verifying paymaster sponsor the user operation's gas fees
- Executed a simple transaction to `vitalik.eth`'s address

All in a couple lines of code.

Congratulations, you are now a pioneer of Account Abstraction! 🎉

### Combined code

If you want to see the complete code that combines all of the previous steps, we uploaded it to a [separate repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorials). If you're looking to run it, remember to replace the API key with your own!
