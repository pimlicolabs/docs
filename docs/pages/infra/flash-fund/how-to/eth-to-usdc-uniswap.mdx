# How to create a user operation which converts ETH to USDC on Uniswap V3

This guide demonstrates how to create a user operation that swaps ETH for USDC using Uniswap V3. By leveraging Account Abstraction and Pimlico's infrastructure, you can create gasless swaps and provide a seamless experience for your users.

## Prerequisites

- A Pimlico API key (get one from the [Pimlico Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io))
- Basic understanding of Account Abstraction and ERC-4337
- Familiarity with TypeScript and Viem
- Access to a network with Uniswap V3 deployed (we'll use Sepolia in this example)

## Steps

::::steps

### Set up the clients

First, we need to set up the necessary clients for interacting with the blockchain and Pimlico's services. We'll create a public client for reading from the blockchain and a Pimlico client for interacting with Pimlico's bundler and paymaster services.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:clients]
```

### Create a smart account

For this guide, we'll use a Safe smart account. This account is an ERC-4337 wallet controlled by a single EOA signer.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:smartAccount]
```

### Create the smart account client

Now that we have a `SmartAccount` instance, we need to create a `SmartAccountClient` instance to be able to transact from it. We'll also configure it to use Pimlico's bundler and paymaster services.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Define the Uniswap V3 interface

To interact with Uniswap V3, we need to define the ABI for the functions we'll be using. We'll also define the addresses for the Uniswap V3 Router, WETH, and USDC tokens.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:uniswapInterfaces]
```

The addresses provided in this example are for the Sepolia testnet. Make sure to replace them with the correct addresses for the network you're using.

### Create swap helper functions

Now, let's create helper functions for getting a quote and creating the calldata for swapping ETH to USDC.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:swapFunctions]
```

These functions handle:
1. Getting a quote for the expected amount of USDC to receive
2. Calculating the minimum amount out based on slippage
3. Setting a deadline for the swap
4. Encoding the function call to the Uniswap V3 Router

### Execute the swap

Finally, let's create a function to execute the swap and submit the user operation.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:executeSwap]
```

This function:
1. Converts the ETH amount to wei
2. Gets a quote for the expected amount of USDC
3. Creates the swap calldata
4. Submits the user operation to the bundler
5. Returns the transaction hash

### Run the swap

Now, let's execute the swap with a small amount of ETH.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:main]
```

When you run this code, you should see output similar to:

```
Smart account address: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x...
Swapping 0.01 ETH for USDC...
Expected to receive approximately 25.123456 USDC for 0.01 ETH
Swap transaction submitted: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x...
```

## How it works

This example demonstrates several key concepts:

1. **Account Abstraction**: We're using a smart account to execute the swap, which allows for more complex operations than a regular EOA.
2. **Gasless Transactions**: By using Pimlico's paymaster, we can sponsor the gas fees for the user operation.
3. **Uniswap V3 Integration**: We're interacting with Uniswap V3's `exactInputSingle` function to swap ETH for USDC.
4. **Slippage Protection**: We calculate a minimum amount out based on the expected amount and a slippage percentage.

## Next steps

- Explore other Uniswap V3 functions like `exactOutput` or `exactOutputSingle`
- Add support for swapping between other token pairs
- Implement a UI for users to input the amount and token pair
- Add error handling and retry logic for failed swaps
