# How to debug dropped user operations

If a user operation is dropped in the mempool of the bundler after initially being accepted by it, the error can not be propagated by the bundler to the user. To debug what happened to there user operations, we recommend using the [User Operation Tracking](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/debugging/tracking) page on our dashboard, which will show you the exact flow of the user operation stage-by-stage through Pimlico's bundler with timestamps, including any errors it encounters.

An example screenshot of the User Operation Tracking page is shown below:
