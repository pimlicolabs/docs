:::

The MagicSpend++ protocol solves the problem of having a fragmented balances across multiple chains. It allows users to spend their assets on any chain without having to worry about bridging.

## Abstract

MagicSpend++ allows users to request funds on any chain they need, by sending a single withdraw request to a MagicSpend++ contract. This call contains all the details about recipient, amount, asset, etc as long as the valid signature, made by Pimlico.

Pimlico authorizes these signatures in exchange for a portion of the user's stake, under a 'pay now, debit later' mechanism. As a security measure, all balances taken from the user by Pimlico must be explicitly authorized via a signature from the user.
