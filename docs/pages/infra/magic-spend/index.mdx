# Magic Spend

Magic Spend protocol solves the problem of having a fragmented balance across multiple chains. It allows users to spend their assets on any chain without having to worry about bridging.

## Abstract

Magic Spend allows users to request funds on any chain they need, by sending a single call to a Magic Spend contract. This call contains all the details about recipient, amount, asset, etc as long as the valid signature, made by Pimlico.

On the other hand, Pimlico provides such signatures in exchange for part of the user's stake. To claim part of user's stake, Pimlico has to provide the similar details, but signed by the user.
