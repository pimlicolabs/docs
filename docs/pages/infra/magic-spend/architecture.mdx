## Overview

Magic Spend is a protocol that allows users to spend their funds on any chain they need. It consists of two main components: `MagicSpendStakeManager` and `MagicSpendWithdrawManager`. The first one is responsible for managing user stakes, while the second one is responsible for managing the liquidity of the protocol. Each supported chain has its own instance of these contracts.

## MagicSpendStakeManager

`MagicSpendStakeManager` is a contract that manages user stakes. The stake can be in native tokens (ETH, Matic, etc) or any ERC20 token. Users can add, unlock, and remove their staked balances. Pimlico has no control over the staked balances, and the user can remove them at any time. These funds are not used in fullfilling the user's requests. These stakes can only be claimed by Pimlico if the user explicitly provides a signed ClaimRequest message to authorize Pimlico to do so.

### `ClaimRequest` message

```solidity
struct ClaimStruct {
    /// @dev Asset that can be claimed.
    address asset;
    /// @dev The amount to claim.
    uint128 amount;
    /// @dev The fee to claim.
    uint128 fee;
    /// @dev Chain id of the network, where the request will be claimed.
    uint128 chainId;
}

struct ClaimRequest {
    /// @dev Address which stake is claimed.
    address account;
    /// @dev List of claims, one claim per chain id
    ClaimStruct[] claims;
    /// @dev The time in which the request is valid until.
    uint48 validUntil;
    /// @dev The time in which the request is valid after.
    uint48 validAfter;
    /// @dev The salt of the request.
    uint48 salt;
    /// @dev Address which allowed to request WithdrawRequests on behalf of this ClaimRequest.
    address signer;
}
```

`ClaimRequest` is a message that user signs and sends to Pimlico. It contains the details of the stake, such as the asset, amount, fee, chain id, etc. Pimlico can claim the user's stake only if the user provided a signed `ClaimRequest` message.

Each `ClaimRequest` can have many `claims`, where each claim represents a single chain. It allows users to provide parts of their stake on different chains in a single request.

### Upgradability

:::warning[Warning]

MagicSpend++ contracts are upgradable with a timelock equal to one week.

:::

Pimlico can upgrade the contracts to add new features or fix bugs. However, the upgradability is only available with a timelock equal to one week, so users have enough time to withdraw their funds if they don't agree with the changes.

## MagicSpendWithdrawManager

`MagicSpendWithdrawManager` is a contract that manages the liquidity of the Magic Spend protocol. It allows users to request withdrawals on any chain they need. This contract has no user's funds and stores only liquidity, added by Pimlico. Users can request withdrawals of their funds, if they provide a `WithdrawRequest` message, signed by Pimlico.

### `WithdrawRequest` message

```solidity
/// @notice Helper struct that represents a call to make.
struct CallStruct {
    address to;
    uint256 value;
    bytes data;
}

struct WithdrawRequest {
    /// @dev Asset that user wants to withdraw.
    address asset;
    /// @dev The requested amount to withdraw.
    uint128 amount;
    /// @dev Chain id of the network, where the request will be withdrawn.
    uint128 chainId;
    /// @dev Address that will receive the funds.
    address recipient;
    /// @dev Calls that will be made before the funds are sent to the user.
    CallStruct[] preCalls;
    /// @dev Calls that will be made after the funds are sent to the user.
    CallStruct[] postCalls;
    /// @dev The time in which the request is valid until.
    uint48 validUntil;
    /// @dev The time in which this request is valid after.
    uint48 validAfter;
    /// @dev The salt of the request.
    uint48 salt;
}
```

`WithdrawRequest` is a message that Pimlico signs and sends to user. It contains the details of the withdrawal, such as the asset, amount, recipient, chain id, etc.

## Magic Spend Flow

This section describes the flow of the MagicSpend++ protocol. In order to start using MagicSpend++, users have to stake their funds. Read how to do that in the [Staking](/infra/magic-spend/staking) section.

1. User stakes their funds in the `MagicSpendStakeManager` contract, on one or many networks.
2. User sends a `pimlico_prepareMagicSpendClaimRequest` call, which returns the `ClaimRequest`
3. User signs the `ClaimRequest` and sends it with `pimlico_sendMagicSpendClaimRequest` call.
4. Pimlico validates the `ClaimRequest` and returns it's hash.
5. User sends a `pimlico_getMagicSpendWithdrawRequest` call, where they specify the asset, amount, recipient, chain id, etc.
6. Pimlico signs the corresponding `WithdrawRequest` and returns it with a signature to user
7. User sends a transaction, which contains `MagicSpendLiquidityManager.withdraw(WithdrawRequest request, bytes signature)` call and receives the funds.
8. Once `WithdrawRequest` is executed, Pimlico can claim the user's stake by calling `MagicSpendStakeManager.claim(ClaimRequest request, bytes signature)`.
