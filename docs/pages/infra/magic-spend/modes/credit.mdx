# Credit Mode

Magic Spend Credit mode is designed for developers who want to provide instant ETH access to their users across multiple chains without requiring users to lock their own tokens. This mode is perfect for demos, testing, and small-scale applications.

## Overview

Credit mode simplifies token access by shifting liquidity management from users to developers. Developers can top up their balance through the Pimlico dashboard and instantly provide ETH to users on any supported chain using their API key.

## Key Features

- **Instant ETH Provision**: Provide ETH instantly on any supported chain
- **Developer-Funded Model**: Manage funds through the Pimlico dashboard
- **Webhook Support**: Monitor and validate withdrawals
- **Simple Integration**: Minimal setup required
- **Currently ETH Only**: Support for ETH withdrawals across all supported chains

## How It Works

1. **Developer Setup**
   - Get a Pimlico API key in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys)
   - Enable Magic Spend feature for your API key
   - Add funds to your Magic Spend balance through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/billing/payment-methods)

2. **User Flow**
   - User requests ETH on a specific chain
   - Developer uses API to request signed withdrawal message
   - User receives ETH directly on the target chain

3. **Fund Management**
   - Monitor balance through the dashboard
   - Set up automatic top-ups (optional)
   - Track usage with webhooks
