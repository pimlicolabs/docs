# Resource Lock Mode

Magic Spend Resource Lock mode is designed for production-scale applications, enabling users to lock their tokens in specialized smart contracts and instantly access ETH across any supported chain through simple message signing.

## Overview

Resource Lock mode eliminates the need for developer funding by allowing users to lock their own tokens in specialized contracts (OneBalance or Pimlico Lock). This enables immediate cross-chain liquidity while maintaining user control over their assets.

## Key Features

- **No Developer Funding Required**: Users lock their own tokens
- **User-Controlled Assets**: Users maintain control over their locked funds
- **Instant Cross-Chain Access**: Quick access to ETH on any supported chain
- **Multiple Lock Types**: Choose between Pimlico Lock and OneBalance
- **Currently ETH Only**: Support for ETH withdrawals across all supported chains

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Choose a resource lock type (Pimlico Lock or OneBalance)
   - Set up necessary integrations

2. **User Flow**
   - User locks their tokens in the chosen resource lock
   - User requests ETH on desired chain
   - User signs withdrawal message
   - User receives ETH on target chain

3. **Lock Management**
   - Users can monitor their locked balances
   - Unlock funds when needed
