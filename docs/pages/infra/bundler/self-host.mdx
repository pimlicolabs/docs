# Self-Host Guide

This guide holds all information related to self hosting your own Alto bundler instance. Including installation, setting up, running, and troubleshooting.

## Installation (Building from source)

To install and build Alto from source, run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlicolabs/alto.git
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

And then to start Alto, run

```bash
./alto help
```

## Setup And Prerequisites

Alto manages multiple executor wallets. If any wallet's balance falls below a set minimum, its balance is automatically refilled using funds from the utility wallet. The utility wallet needs to be funded before starting Alto.

EntryPoint V0.7 relies on a simulation contract to be deployed. Alto uses this contract during validation and gas estimations. `0x74cb5e4ee81b86e70f9045036a1c5477de69ee87` is the address of the simulation contract on all chains that we support. You can deploy the same contract to any network by using [this helper function](https://gist.github.com/mouseless0x/9221f12542553250252f3dbc22b5e1c1)

##### Prerequisites:

- Utility wallet is funded
- Simulations contract is deployed

## Running

Once all the prerequisite conditions are met, Alto can be started using

```bash
./alto run
    --entrypoints "0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032,0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789"
    --entrypoint-simulation-contract "0x74cb5e4ee81b86e70f9045036a1c5477de69ee87"
    --executor-private-keys "0x34e9a7...,0xb08d34...,0x163cbb..."
    --utility-private-keys "0xe768f1..."
    --rpc-url "http://localhost:8545"
    --safe-mode false
```

### Running Alto using JSON configurations

Alto can also be ran using configurations from a JSON file

Create and setup `alto-config.json`

```
{
    "entrypoints": "0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032,0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789",
    "entrypoint-simulation-contract": "0x74cb5e4ee81b86e70f9045036a1c5477de69ee87",
    "executor-private-keys": "0x34e9a7...,0xb08d34...,0x163cbb...",
    "utility-private-keys": "0xe768f1...",
    "rpc-url": "http://localhost:8545",
    "safe-mode": false
}
```

Run Alto using `alto-config.json` configurations

```bash
./alto run --config "alto-config.json"
```

:::tip[Tip]
It is recommended to run Alto using `safe-mode=false` as it will skip the ERC-7562 reputation checks and DOS prevention. To run alto with `safe-mode=true`, you will need to provide an RPC that has debug_traceCall enabled.

## compatibility

Some chains have certain compatibility restrictions that require Alto to be ran with special flags.

#### Legacy Transaction Chains
For chains that only support pre EIP-1559 transactions, alto needs to be ran with the flag

```bash
./alto run --legacy-transactions ...
```

#### OP Stack Chains
For chains that are deployed using the OP Stack, alto needs to be ran with the flag

```bash
./alto run --chain-type "op-stack" ...
```

#### Arbitrum Chains
For chains that are deployed using Arbitrum, alto needs to be ran with the flag

```bash
./alto run --chain-type "arbitrum" ...
```
