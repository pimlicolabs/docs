# Explanation

Explanation is a discursive treatment of a subject, that permits _reflection_. Explanation is
**understanding-oriented**.

* * *

Explanation deepens and broadens the reader's understanding of a subject. It brings clarity, light and context.

The concept of _reflection_ is important. Reflection occurs _after_ something else, and depends on something else, yet at the same time brings something new - shines a new light - on the subject matter.

The perspective of explanation is higher and wider than that of the other not types. It does not take the user's eye-level view, as in a how-to guide, or a close-up view of the machinery, like reference material. Its scope in each case is a topic - "an area of knowledge", that somehow has to be bounded in a reasonable, meaningful way.

For the user, explanation joins things together. It's an answer to the question: _Can you tell me about …?_

It's documentation that it makes sense to read while away from the product itself (one could say, explanation is the only kind of documentation that it might make sense to read in the bath).

## The value and place of explanation

### Explanation and understanding

Explanation is characterised by its distance from the active concerns of the practitioner. It doesn't have direct implications for what they do, or for their work. This means that it's sometimes seen as being of lesser importance. That's a mistake; it may be less _urgent_ than the other three, but it's no less _important_. It's not a luxury. No practitioner of a craft can afford to be without an
understanding of that craft, and needs the explanatory material that will help weave it together.

The word _explanation_ - and its cognates in other languages - refer to _unfolding_, the revelation of what is hidden in the folds. So explanation brings to the light things that were implicit or obscured.

Similarly, words that mean _understanding_ share roots in words meaning to hold or grasp (as in _comprehend_). That's an important part of understanding, to be able to hold something or be in possession of it. Understanding seals together the other components of our mastery of a craft, and makes it safely our own.

Understanding doesn't _come from_ explanation, but explanation is required to form that web that helps hold
everything together. Without it, the practitioner's knowledge of their craft is loose and fragmented and fragile, and
their exercise of it is _anxious_.

### Explanation and its boundaries

Quite often explanation is not explicitly recognised in documentation; and the idea that things need to be
explained is often only faintly expressed. Instead, explanation tends to be scattered in small parcels in other
sections.

It's not always easy to write good explanatory material. Where does one start? It's also not clear where to conclude.
There is an open-endedness about it that can give the writer too many possibilities.

Tutorials, how-to-guides and reference are all clearly defined in their scope by something that is also well-defined:
by what you need the user to learn, what task the user needs to achieve, or just by the scope of the machine itself.

In the case of explanation, it's useful to have a real or imagined _why_ question to serve as a prompt. Otherwise, you
simply have to draw some lines that mark out a reasonable area and be satisfied with that.

## Writing good explanation

### Make connections

When writing explanation you are helping to weave a web of understanding for your readers. **Make connections** to
other things, even to things outside the immediate topic, if that helps.

### Provide context

**Provide background and context in your explanation**: explain _why_ things are so - design decisions, historical
reasons, technical constraints - draw implications, mention specific examples.

### Talk _about_ the subject

Explanation guides are _about_ a topic in the sense that they are _around_ it. Even the names of your explanation
guides should reflect this; you should be able to place an implicit (or even explicit) _about_ in front of each
title. For example: _About user authentication_, or _About database connection policies_.

### Admit opinion and perspective

Opinion might seem like a funny thing to introduce into documentation. The fact is that all human activity and knowledge is invested within opinion, with beliefs and thoughts. The reality of any human creation is rich with opinion, and that needs to be part of any understanding of it.

Similarly, any understanding comes from a perspective, a particular stand-point - which means that other perspectives and stand-points exist. **Explanation can and must consider alternatives**, counter-examples or multiple different approaches to the same question.

In explanation, you're not giving instruction or describing facts - you're opening up the topic for consideration. It helps to think of explanation as discussion: discussions can even consider and weigh up contrary _opinions_.

### Keep explanation closely bounded

One risk of explanation is that it tends to absorb other things. The writer, intent on covering the topic, feels the urge to include instruction or technical description related to it. But documentation already has other places for these, and allowing them to creep in interferes with the explanation itself, and removes them from view in the correct place.

## The language of explanation

_The reason for x is because historically, y …_

Explain.

_W is better than z, because …_

Offer judgements and even opinions where appropriate..

_An x in system y is analogous to a w in system z. However …_

Provide context that helps the reader.

_Some users prefer w (because z). This can be a good approach, but…_

Weigh up alternatives.

_An x interacts with a y as follows: …_

Unfold the machinery's internal secrets, to help understand why something does what it does.

## Analogy from food and cooking

In 1984 [Harold McGee](https://www.curiouscook.com/) published _On food and cooking_.

![](https://diataxis.fr/_images/mcgee.jpg)

The book doesn't teach how to cook anything. It doesn't contain recipes (except as historical examples) and it isn't a work of reference. Instead, it places food and cooking in the context of history, society, science and technology. It explains for example why we do what we do in the kitchen and how that has changed.

It's clearly not a book we would read _while_ cooking. We would read when we want to reflect on cooking. It illuminates the subject by taking multiple different perspectives on it, shining light from different angles.

After reading a book like _On food and cooking_, our understanding is changed. Our knowledge is richer and deeper. What we have learned may or may not be immediately applicable next time we are doing something in the kitchen, but _it will change how_
_we think about our craft, and will affect our practice_.
